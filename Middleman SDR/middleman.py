# This program, Middleman, acts as a middleman between the OBC and the GNU Radio SDR program, prompting it to run and trasnferring data.

# This program is designed to run upon Payload Linux startup, probably once compiled as its own .exe file or whatever Linux uses

# By the CySat-1 Team

# Contact Steven Scheuermann for help, ultimatesteve99@gmail.com


# Serial Setup
ser = serial.Serial('/dev/serial0', 115200, timeout=10) # This will have to be changed once we test with the actual machine



# Initial Declarations
StartupDelay=1 #For deployment switch to 600 seconds
MeasurementDelay=1 #For deployment this might be OBC specified, unsure
StartupMeasurement=True


# Waits a certain amount of time for system to warm up, ask Matt
time.sleep(StartupDelay)


# Checks if take measurement at startup is true or false
if StartupMeasurement == True:
    # If true, take measurement, if false, skip and go to additional commands. This might change to needing OBC prompt to take measurement.
    os.system('cmd /c "python radiometer_app.py"') # The path has to be changed a bit for this to work but it might eventually work


    # Waits for measurment to be taken, until OBC responds with send me the measurement
    time.sleep(MeasurementDelay)

    # ---> Sends first file
    f = open("test.kelvin", "r")
    print(f.readline())
    ser.write('Sent %d time(s)')

    # Waits for OBC response

    # If error, try resending, but if 2 errors, send abort message and delete measurement probably

    # If success, delete measurement, step not needed if GNU radio does this automatically, unsure if overwrite deletes or overwrites

    # ---> Sends second file

    # Waits for OBC response

    # If error, try resending, but if 2 errors, send abort message and delete measurement probably

    # If success, delete measurement, step not needed if GNU radio does this automatically, unsure if overwrite deletes or overwrites

    # Send "All done" message to the OBC

    # If take measurement at startup is disabled, skip to here

    # Wait for OBC to send message for changing SDR settings

    # After settings change, send "All done" message to OBC

    # After any All Done, the OBC may decide to turn the Payload off, so the program should be in a stable configuration at that point
